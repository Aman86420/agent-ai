AI CONTENT GENERATION PIPELINE: INSTALLATION
==============================================

This document contains all necessary dependencies and terminal commands to set up
and run the Streamlit application.

-------------------------
1. DEPENDENCIES (PIP LIST)
-------------------------

The following packages are required for the project. These should be saved in a
'requirements.txt' file in the root directory.

# requirements.txt
streamlit
google-genai
langchain
langchain-google-genai
Pillow


-------------------------
2. SETUP AND RUN COMMANDS
-------------------------

Follow these steps in your terminal to create an isolated environment and run the app.
NOTE: Replace 'app.py' with the actual name of your main Python file if different.

### STEP 1: Create the 'requirements.txt' file

Create a new file named 'requirements.txt' in your project folder and paste the 
five dependencies listed above into it.

### STEP 2: Create a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

# Windows (CMD/PowerShell)
python -m venv venv

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv


### STEP 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

You must activate the environment before installing dependencies.

# Windows (CMD/PowerShell)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate


### STEP 4: Install Dependencies

Use pip to install all required packages listed in 'requirements.txt'.

pip install -r requirements.txt


### STEP 5: Run the Application

Once installation is complete, you can start the Streamlit application.

streamlit run <your_script_name>.py

# Example (if your file is named app.py):
# streamlit run app.py

A browser window will automatically open with the application running.


### STEP 6: Deactivate (When finished)

When you are done working on the project, run this command to exit the virtual environment.

deactivate
